# Forest-Fire-Simulator
I wanted to create a program that can be used to further understand a modern environmental crisis that damages millions of ecosystems: forest fires. 
The Forest Fire simulator calculates the realistic and accurate daily growth of a forest fire, given values such as the wind speed, direction, and type of wood.
This project was the Winner of the MakeSPP Environmental Track Hackathon.

In the simulation:

. = Normal Forest

/ = Forest Starting to burn

\# = Forest fully on fire
- = Forest burnt out
